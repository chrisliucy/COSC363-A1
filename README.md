Computer Graphics OpenGL Museum Assignment

In this assignment, you will develop a graphics application to display your version of an OpenGL Museum that houses a few interesting exhibits created using OpenGL models.
The assignment task can be broadly divided into four sections:

Minimum requirements (10 marks): The scene should contain a set of minimum features as outlined in Section 2.

Extra features (5 marks): You can implement a set of extra features and gain up to a maximum of 5 marks. A few examples of such features are given in Section 3.

Rendering quality (3 marks): Up to 3 marks are allocated for the overall rendering quality of the scene, including animations (Section 4).

Report (2 marks): You should also prepare a brief report containing a few screenshots and a description of the scene (see Section 5).
